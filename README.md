Solutions and test cases for various programming challenges. Many are taken from LeetCode, others from [Stephen Grider's](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/) Udemy Course on [Coding Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/).

Mainly doing this for interview practice.
